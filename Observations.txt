1. The hight the latitude, the lower the temprature. The lower the latitude, the higher the temprature. I believe this correlation between latitude and temprature exists due to the cities location in relation to the equator and poles.

2. Cities at higher latitudes appear to have humidity levels between 60-100%

3. Citites as a higher latitude seem to experience slightly more cloudiness and windiness compared to cities at lower latitudes
